# Python Cricketer Analysis
### Web scraping and visualisation of different cricketers

I have built a webscraper using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` so that I can get a list of the test innings of any cricketer using the ESPN cricinfo website. 

Using the class `Cricketer` ([found here](/Cricketer.py)) I can apply a number of methods to produce summary statistics and rolling averages that can be used to analyse the performance of the player.
